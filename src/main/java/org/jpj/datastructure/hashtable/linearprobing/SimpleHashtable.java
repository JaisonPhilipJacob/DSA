        //Rehashing -Why?
        /*
           In linear probing we find the first unoccupied slot when we try to add a data to a position
           which is already taken. Now when removing, when we exercise linear probing to find the
           element, if an element from a previously occupied slot is already removed, the probing will
           fail. For eg, suppose we wanted to add an element to position 1, but that is occupied. Then
           we probe and see if we can add to postion 2,3,4 but that is also occupied and we store in
           position 5.

           Now suppose we already deleted data in position 2, and if we try to find the element in
           position 5 by probing it will fail, because position was used initially since position 2 was
           occupied. But now since position 2 is empty, the probing will not go to 5 it will stop at 2.

           This is why we use rehashing. So that data is adjusted to its immediate vacant space.
